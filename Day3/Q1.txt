What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it with an example?

Static Variables: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared
among all objects at a class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class 
share the same static variable.


Non Static variables: Both local and instance variable comprise to form Non static variables-

Local Variable- When a variable is declared inside a particular block or method it is accessed by that block only.
which means it is locally accessible.

Instance Variable:It is Similar to global variable but it is declared inside a particular class. And all the members of that class 
can access it.
