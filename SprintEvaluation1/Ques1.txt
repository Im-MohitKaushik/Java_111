Q1 Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write some
of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

String: String is a collection of alphabets or characters.Strings are immutable in java because whenever a string is 
declared in java it occupies a space in memory and when a new string is initialized with the same data. java instead
of forming a new string it creates a path to the previous string and the second string indicates the first string.
If mutablity is possible then changes in first string will also be done on the second string.Hence strings are 
immutable in nature.

String Builder: String Builder is a class which can perform few operations on a string. Or in other words string builder class 
helps strings to show mutability.

Methods of string class:
1.string.concat(); : This method is used for concaination
ex:- 
let String = "Mohit";
system.out.println(String.concat(1));    ==> Mohit1

2.string.equals(a); :This method is used to compare two strings.
let String2 = "Abhishek";
System.out.println(String.equals(String));   ==> It will give boolean false as both strings are diffrent.

3.charAt(); :- this method is used to find the particular character at the provided index;
ex:-
String.charAt(3);  ==> i

4.contains(); :- it will check weather the string contains that value or not
ex:- String.contain("o");  ==> true;

5.length(); it is used to find the length of the string.
ex:- String.length(); ==> 5
