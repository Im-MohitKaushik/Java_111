Q3) How does java achieve platform independency?

Java is a platform independent language which means write anywhere run
anywhere. It means that we can write java codes in any computer and in any
operating system and can run that code in any other PC. And this is aquired
by the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) which converts the codes into Byte codes
which are universally acceptable.
