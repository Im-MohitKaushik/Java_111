What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword in java explain with example.

This:- This keyword is used to access the items of a particular class it was
made to eliminate the confusion between same name variables.

ex:- class Java{
     int name;
     void main(String name){
        this.name;
 	}
    }
this.name will indicate the String name.


Super:- This keyword is used to refer the objects of the parent class it was 
designed to eliminate the confusion between elements of the child class
and the parent class having same name.
