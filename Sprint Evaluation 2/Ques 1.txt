Q1) Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
example and explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?

IS-A Relationship: This type of relationship is established between a parent class 
and a child class. Inheritance can be a example of a IS-A relationship.

ex:- class Student{
String name;
String uniformColor;
}

class Employee extends Student{
String employeeId;
}

In this example the class employee can access the variables of its parent class Student.


Has-A Relationship: This type of relationship is established two classes. When a class 
is declared as instance variable for another class it is said to be in a Has-A Relationship.

ex:-
class Student{

 class junior{
  
 }
}

In this example the relationship established is known as has a relationship.

1. Public- When a function is declared as public it is accessible by each an every member of that package.

2. Private- When a method is declared as private then the only members of thatparticular function can access it.
